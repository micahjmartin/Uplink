# Uplink

Uplink is designed to be CTF challenge where competitors, given only a custom protocol spec, blackbox hack their way into a remote satellite.

> It has been decided that Uplink as one challenge is too difficult. It will be made into Uplink and Uplink 2. Uplink will just be a basic challenge of implementing the custom protocol, and Uplink 2 will be the original blackbox pwn challenge.
